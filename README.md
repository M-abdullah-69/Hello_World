Randomized Meldable Priority Queues Anna Gambin and Adam Malinowski Instytut Informatyki, Uniwersytet Warszawski, Banacha 2, Warszawa 02-097, Poland, faniag,amalg@mimuw.edu.pl Abstract. We present a practical meldable priority queue implementation. All priority queue operations are very simple and their logarithmic time bound holds with high probability, which makes this data structure more suitable for real-time applications than those with only amortized performance guarantees. Our solution is also space-e�cient, since it does not require storing any auxiliary information within the queue nodes. 1 Introduction In this paper we present a randomized approach to the problem of e�cient meldable priority queue implementation. The operations supported by this data structure are the following [10]: MakeQueue returns an empty priority queue. FindMin(Q) returns the minimum item from priority queue Q. DeleteMin(Q) deletes and returns the minimum item from priority queue Q. Insert(Q; e) inserts item e into priority queue Q. Meld(Q1; Q2) returns the priority queue formed by combining disjoint priority queues Q1 and Q2. DecreaseKey(Q; e; e0 ) replaces item e by e 0 in priority queue Q provided e 0 � e and the location of e in Q is known. Delete(Q; e) deletes item e from priority queue Q provided the location of e in Q is known. (The last two operations are sometimes considered optional.) In existing priority queue implementations the approach is two-fold. Most data structures require storing additional balance information associated with queue nodes in order to guarantee the worst-case e�ciency of individual operations (e.g. leftist trees [8], relaxed heaps [5], Brodal queues [3, 4]). Others achieve good amortized performance by adjusting the structure during some operations rather than struggling to maintain balance constantly (skew heaps [12, 13], pairing heaps [6]). Experiments indicate that the latter approach is more promising in practice [1, 7, 9]. This is due to the fact that the worst-case e�cient structures tend to be complex and hard to implement therefore big constant factors hidden in their complexity estimates prevail their theoretically superior performance. On the other hand, the main disadvantage of the amortized approach is that it cannot be applied in real-time programs, where the worst-case bound on the running time of each individual operation is crucial. Our solution, both simple and worst-case e�cient (in the probabilistic sense), avoids these drawbacks by adopting the randomized approach, earlier applied to construct abstract data structures mainly in the context of dictionaries (e.g. [2, 11]). The idea is loosely based on leftist trees and skew heaps. All other operations are dened in terms of Meld which in both structures is performed along right paths in melded trees. The subtrees of a node on the right path are exchanged in order to keep the path short: in leftist trees { sometimes (depending on their ranks); in skew heaps { always. In our data structure Meld operation is performed along random paths in melded trees. This approach has the following advantages: Simplicity. All operations are easy to implement and the constant factors in their complexity bounds are small, thus, given a fast random number generator, the heaps should perform well in practice. Space economy. Since we do not need to preserve any balance conditions, no satellite information within nodes is necessary. Applicability to parallel computations. A single-pass top-down scheme of each operation allows to perform a sequence of operations in a pipelined fashion. Moreover, the loose structure of a heap allows to process disjoint sets of nodes independently. Worst-case e�ciency. The execution time of each individual operation is at most logarithmic with high probability. The expected time behaviour depends on the random choices made by the algorithm rather than the distribution of an input sequence, which allows using this data structure in real-time applications. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data structure and the implementation of meldable priority queue operations. Section 3 is devoted to the e�ciency analysis of these algorithms. Section 4 presents some experimental results. Finally, Section 5 contains discussion of some extensions of the data structure and the conclusions. 2 The Randomized Heap The underlying data structure of the randomized heap is a binary tree with one item per node, satisfying heap property: if x and y are nodes and x is the parent of y then item(x) � item(y). The heap is accessed by the root of the tree. Let us now describe the implementation of meldable priority queue operations for randomized heap. MakeQueue returns an empty tree and FindMin returns an item held in the root. In order to Meld two nonempty trees with roots Q1 and Q2, respectively, we compare the items held in the roots. The root with the smaller key, say Q1, becomes the root of the resulting tree and Q2, the remaining one, is recursively melded with either left or right child of Q1, depending on the outcome of a coin toss. More formal denition is given by the following pseudocode: heap function Meld(heap Q1; Q2) if Q1 = null ) return Q2 if Q2 = null ) return Q1 if item(Q1) > item(Q2) ) Q1 $ Q2 if toss coin = heads ) lef t(Q1) := Meld(lef t(Q1); Q2) else right(Q1) := Meld(right(Q1); Q2) return Q1 (The results of Section 3 imply that the recursion depth is at most logarithmic with high probability. Moreover, this tail-recursion is easily removable and serves the purpose of increasing readability only.) The simplest way to describe all remaining priority queue operations is to dene them in terms of Meld. In order to Insert item e into heap Q we create a single node containing item e and meld it with Q. DeleteMin melds the left and right subtrees of the root and returns the item held in the (old) root. For DecreaseKey and Delete we need the parent pointer in each node. In order to decrease the value of node x in heap Q we detach the tree rooted at x from Q, adjust the item at x accordingly and then meld Q with the heap rooted at x. Operation Delete also detaches the tree rooted at x from heap Q, and then performs DeleteMin on heap rooted at x and nally Meld the resulting heap and Q. 3 The E�ciency Analysis Since all non-constant-time operations are dened in terms of Meld, it is enough to analyze the complexity of melding two randomized heaps. Let us x an arbitrary binary tree Q with n interior nodes containing keys and n + 1 exterior null nodes { the leaves of the tree. Dene a random variable hQ to be the length (the number of edges) of a random path from the root down to an exterior node (the child following each interior node on a path is chosen randomly and independently). In other words, the probability space is the set of all exterior nodes in Q with probability of a node at depth t equal to 2t , and hQ is the depth of an exterior node chosen randomly with respect to this distribution. Lemma 1. Melding two randomized heaps Q1 and Q2 requires time O(hQ1 + hQ2 ). Proof. The melding procedure traverses a random path in each tree until an exterior node in one of them is reached. ut It follows from Lemma 1 that in order to bound the complexity of melding randomized heaps it is enough to estimate hQ for an arbitrary binary tree Q Theorem 1. Let Q be an arbitrary binary tree with n interior nodes. (a) The expected value EhQ � log(n + 1). (b) P r[hQ > (c + 1) log n] < 1 nc , for any constant c > 0. Proof. (a) The proof follows by induction on n. Assume n > 0 and let nL and nR be the number of interior nodes in the left (QL) and right (QR) subtree of Q, respectively (thus n = nL + nR + 1). We have EhQ = 1 2 ((1 + EhQL ) + (1 + EhQR )) � 1 + 1 2 (log(nL + 1) + log(nR + 1)) = log 2p (nL + 1)(nR + 1) � log 2 (nL + 1) + (nR + 1) 2 = log(nL + nR + 2) = log(n + 1) (b) Note that for any xed path from the root to an exterior node the probability that is the outcome of a random walk down the tree equals 2j j , where j j is the length of . Let be the set of all paths from the root to an exterior node in Q with length exceeding (c + 1) log n. We have Pr[hQ > (c + 1) log n] = X
